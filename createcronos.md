## ğŸª„API

Generate your **own project generator** adapted to the needs of your organization in record time using the Create Cronos API.

### Config file

Create a `config.ts` file in the root of your template with the following structure:

```typescript
import { Config } from "./types/Config";

const config: Config = {
  projects: [],
  preMiddleware: () => {
    return [];
  },
  postMiddleware: () => {
    return [];
  },
};

export default config;
```

Let's see what each of the properties of the `Config` object is for:

- `projects`: Array of projects that can be generated.

```typescript
interface Project {
  name: string;
  value: string;
  type: "local" | "external";
  requestProjectName?: boolean;
  steps: Function[];
  path?: string;
  execCommand?: string | string[];
}

export { Project };
```

- `preMiddleware`: A function that runs before launching the project's CLI or any other function that the user will interact with. For example:

```typescript
preMiddleware: () => {
    return [() => console.log("ğŸš€ Let's go! ğŸš€")];
},
```

- `postMiddleware`: Once all the processes have finished, this function would be executed. For example:

```typescript
postMiddleware: () => {
  return [() => console.log("ğŸš€ Let's go! ğŸš€")];
};
```
